# Zeneyra Linux
A multi-purpose Linux Distro designed to be easy-to-use, robust, lightweight and secure. Written in Rust, Zig, Nucleus and C.  
Currently, it's still just an idea as it's not actively or directly worked on. It's supposed to have its own Window Manager and Desktop Environment with applications, Package Manager, Shell, Coreutils, but still be compatible across other distros or Unix-like systems.
